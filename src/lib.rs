pub const fn align(addr: usize, align: usize) -> usize {
    // Since align is a power of two, its binary representation has only a single bit set (e.g. 0b000100000). This means that align - 1 has all the lower bits set (e.g. 0b00011111).
    // By creating the bitwise NOT through the ! operator, we get a number that has all the bits set except for the bits lower than align (e.g. 0bâ€¦111111111100000).
    // By performing a bitwise AND on an address and !(align - 1), we align the address downwards. This works by clearing all the bits that are lower than align.
    // Since we want to align upwards instead of downwards, we increase the addr by align - 1 before performing the bitwise AND. This way, already aligned addresses remain the same while non-aligned addresses are rounded to the next alignment boundary.
